# IoT Lab Experiment 1: LED Interfacing with Arduino

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To understand how to configure and control GPIO pins on an Arduino board by interfacing LEDs and writing simple programs for blinking and chasing effects.

## ðŸ“Œ Experiment Tasks

### ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Single LED Blinking
- **Pin**: D2
- **Description**: Turns the LED on and off every 1 second using a delay.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Four LEDs Blinking Together
- **Pins**: D2 to D5
- **Description**: All four LEDs turn on and off at the same time in a loop.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3: LED Chasing (Downward)
- **Description**: LEDs turn on one after the other from top (D2) to bottom (D5), creating a downward chasing effect.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 4: LED Chasing (Upward)
- **Description**: LEDs light up one by one from bottom (D5) to top (D2), giving an upward chasing pattern.

## ðŸ’» Tools Used
- **Hardware**: Arduino UNO, LEDs, Resistors, Breadboard, Jumper Wires  
- **Software**: Arduino IDE
